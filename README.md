# Building-Key-Value-Storage-with-ETCD

Project Goal: Develop a key-value store application that allows users to set and get key-value pairs using etcd for storage.

Install and configure a single-node etcd cluster locally.

Write a program (Python/Go/Java) to connect to the etcd cluster.

Implement funcƟons to list all keys, get the value for a specific key, and put a key-value pair into etcd.

Download and install etcd according to your OS instrucƟons (https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases).

Write functions to:
■ List all keys using etcd client library.
■ Get the value for a specific key provided by the user.
■ Put a key-value pair into etcd, allowing users to specify both key
and value.
